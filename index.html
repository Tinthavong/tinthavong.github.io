							I just love being able to create things that

					<span class="image"><img src="images/comingsoon.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="500" /></span>
				</header>
				<p class="content">Developed in Unity, this game idea came about from imagining "What would happen if
					you were sent
					into a fantasy world and all you had was a gun?" Fantasy Park answers that question. The player is
					thrown into a hostile area filled with dragons, ogres, zombies and more! The player can either take
					their time to enjoy Fantasy Park's sandbox world or they can fight their way out.</p>

					<h2>Causation</h2>
					<p>Gritty 2D action side scroller set in a cyberpunk world. A collaborative effort for Davenport
						University.</p>
					<span class="image"><img src="images/causationDemo.png" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></span>
				</header>
				<p class="content">Causation was developed in Unity. Causation tells the story of a family of bounty
					hunters whose actions have a domino
					effect on not just their own lives, but the world around them. The player controls three characters
					and
					each of their stories revolve around hunting a bounty that eludes each of them. This escaped bounty
					has a profound effect on the world around them.
					I
					contributed by handling version control and merges on github, developing the core gameplay loop and
					varied weapons system
					based on the artists' and
					designer's plans. I also handled implementing character animations and handled creating cutscenes
					with Unity's timeline sequencer. </p>

					<span class="image"><img src="images/faceplantDemo.PNG" alt="" width="800" height="400" /></span>
				</header>
				<p class="content">Faceplant was developed in Unity. Faceplant is an arcadey 3D platformer that
					showcases slick maneuvering off of skyscrapers. The player uses the momentum from running, coupled
					with a grapple hook to swing around the environments. I contributed by creating an NPC AI that has
					simple behavior for the player to latch onto. I utilizied Unity's Shadergraph to implement shaders
					and visuals for the game. I created and implemented a highscore database for the game. I also
					created all the 3D
					models and assets. </p>
